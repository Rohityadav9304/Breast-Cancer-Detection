# Breast-Cancer-Detection
In this project we  detect breast cancer by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based off its characteristics.
We will build a logistic regression model to identify correlations between the following 9 independent variables and the class of the tumor (benign or malignant).



Clump thickness

Uniformity of cell size

Uniformity of cell shape

Marginal adhesion

Single epithelial cell

Bare Nuclei

Bland chromatin

Normal nucleoli

Mitoses

Logistic regression can identify important predictors of breast cancer using odds ratios and generate confidence intervals that provide additional information for decision-making. Model performance depends on the ability of the radiologists to accurately identify findings on mammograms.
